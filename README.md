# PasscodeJWT
Passport authentication using Json web tokens.  Server side code stores email & passwords locally using a mongo shell.  Client side uses HOC (requireAuth.js) restricting access to "Feature" page for authorized users only.  "Feature" can be customized to whatever you want.  Feel free to hit me up with any questions or comments.
